# docx-celtx-converter
This is a python program that will convert docx files formatted like screenplays into celtx files and vice-versa.

Since the first version I've managed to make it. Unfortunately I couldn't figure out how to make the "Featured in:" feature that shows the scenes in which each character appears work. I don't use it much so don't expect for it to be fixed quickly but maybe I'll take another look at it someday.

Edit: It's not working perfectly for me, but I did find an option for adding featured in scenes for characters. It's directly in the Celtx program: Script > Add Characters To Catalog

From now on this code also supports converting comments between files.
