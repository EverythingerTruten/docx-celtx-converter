# docx-celtx-converter
This is a python program that will convert docx files formatted like screenplays into celtx files and vice-versa.

It not only gives you just the screenplay in celtx, it also sets up all characters to show up in the Main Catalog. Unfortunately I couldn't figure out how to make the "Featured in:" feature that shows the scenes in which each character appears work. I don't use it much so don't expect for it to be fixed quickly but maybe I'll take another look at it someday.
